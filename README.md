# Batako Todo:

### Long Term
* Add support for map objects (should make chests possible)
* Add a hotbar
* Add an inventory
* Add text to the ui

### Necessary fixes
Seems like sampler caching isn't working.

### Possible Optimizations
* Split tile maps into chunks and only render chunks that are visible. (This may be slower in some cases and may only be useful for really large maps)
* Add push descriptor functionality for textures.
