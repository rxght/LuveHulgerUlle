# Batako Todo:

### Long Term
* Add an inventory
* Add support for map objects (should make chests possible)

### Possible Optimizations
* Split tile maps into chunks and only render chunks that are visible. (This may be slower in some cases and may only be useful for really large maps)
* Add push descriptor functionality for textures.
